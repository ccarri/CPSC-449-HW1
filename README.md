# Web Back End Homework 1
Extended the Book API built in class with
additional CRUD operations and advanced query features.
I added PUT endpoint, PATCH endpoint, DELETE endpoint, GET endpoint
with pagination, and advanced GET endpoint with
filtering, sorting, and pagination combined in valid order.

## PUT Endpoint
Updates all fields of book.

![PUT /books/{id}](screenshots/screen1.png)

## PATCH Endpoint 
Updates only specified fields of book.

![PATCH /books/{id}](screenshots/screen2.png)

## DELETE Endpoint
Deletes specified book.

![DELETE /books/{id}](screenshots/screen3.png)

## GET Endpoint with Pagination
Retrieves books in chunks based on page and size.

![GET /books/page](screenshots/screen4.png)

## Advanced GET Endpoint with filtering, sorting, and pagination
Retrieves book matching criteria at a more specific level.

![GET /books/advanced](screenshots/screen5.png)
